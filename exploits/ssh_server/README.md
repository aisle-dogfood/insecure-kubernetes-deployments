# Vulnerable SSH Server

A vulnerable SSH server implementation in Elixir for testing and educational purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Building and Running

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t vulnerable-ssh-server .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 22:22 vulnerable-ssh-server
```

## Testing

You can test the server by attempting to connect:
```bash
ssh root@localhost -p 22
```

Note: All login attempts will be logged but rejected.

## Implementation Details

The server is implemented in Elixir and uses the following components:
- Elixir 1.14
- Erlang/OTP SSH library
- Supervisor-based process management
- Basic password authentication (rejects all attempts)

## Security Notes

This is a vulnerable implementation for testing purposes. Do not use in production.
